<p>In this project, we were tasked to create a fictional product based on an emoji. I picked pasta, since it is one of my favorite foods to eat. From there I developed "Pretty Perfect Pasta". I researched other pasta products to see what color schemes they were using to find inspiration. While I was initially leaning towards a red color scheme, I found that most of the pasta products used blue. So I created my own color scheme with that in mind.</p>

<p> After some trial and error, I was able to get the color scheme just the way I wanted it. I liked the idea of using both light and dark blue on the card as I think it draws the eye to both areas. Overall, I enjoyed this project and getting to learn a new way to create with CodePen, which is becoming one of my favorite web design tools.</p>
